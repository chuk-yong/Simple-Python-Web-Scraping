# Simple-Python-Web-Scraping

This was a proof of concept for a client wanting to scrap a comic book website.  Site name was masked for security purpose.

Demonstrate:

1. How to get links using requests, lxml and htlml.
2. Search for image and title using regex.  
3. Download and store files with proper filenames.


This code was good enough to scrape thousands of contents.
